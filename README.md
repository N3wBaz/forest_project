Capstone homework project for RS School Machine Learning course.

This project uses [Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction) dataset.

## Usage
This package allows you to train model for predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables
1. Create project with poetry
2. Download [Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction/data) dataset, save csv locally (default path is *data/forest.csv* in repository's root).
3. Make sure Python 3.9 and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) are installed on your machine (I use Poetry 1.1.13).
